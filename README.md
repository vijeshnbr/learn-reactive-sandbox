# learn-reactive-sandbox
Learn reactive programming paradigm with Project Reactor.

Examples playing around with Reactor Core. Creating Flux, Mono, composing calls etc. A general playground to try something here with just Reactor dependency and plain Java standard library so I can implement same in a Spring Boot app or other apps with complex dependencies.
